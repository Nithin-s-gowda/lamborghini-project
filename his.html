      <h1>
      Ferruccio Lamborghini, the man and his dreams (1916 – 1993)
    </h1>
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>
    <p>Ferruccio Elio Arturo Lamborghini was born on April 28.1916 under the Zodiac sign of Taurus, his parents<br> 
      were farmers but Ferruccio soon decided he wanted to do something with mechanics. He started working on <br>
      his father’s tractor out of interest and was able to attend a technical school in Bologna later on.</p>
    <br>
    <p>During the second World War he was enrolled into the Italian Air Force, working for the transport sections, <br>
      after 1944 he became a prisoner of war in the British military forces who put him to work in their motoring <br>
      department, this way Ferruccio got firsthand experience keeping cars on the road, even with limited part <br>
      supplies.</p>
    <br>
    <p>After the war he returned to his hometown and started converting old war surplus material into much needed <br>
      tractors for the local farmers, the Lamborghini tractor business was inaugurated in a small garage, but the <br>
      business got really successful and had to move into larger premises soon thereafter.</p>
    <br>
    <p>By now Ferruccio also started tuning Fiat cars; he actually built a Fiat Topolino for himself and entered in the <br>
      1948 Mille Miglia competition, unfortunately the car was wrecked in an accident. By 1949 Ferruccio <br>
      Lamborghini was able to start building tractors from scratch, without using any leftovers, the Lamborghini <br>
      Trattori factory was founded and production soon grew even further. The Lamborghini tractors became <br>
      known as the best in Italy and Ferruccio started organizing tractor-pulls in his hometown just to show the <br>
      superiority of his machines.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The tractor business made him a very wealthy man, and he started another factory building air-conditioning <br>
      and central heating equipment. This additional enterprise made Ferruccio Lamborghini even more money and <br>soon 
      he became one of the wealthiest men in Italy, his love for fast cars became legendary as Ferruccio <br>
      owned multiple exotic cars back then, a Mercedes SL300, a Jaguar and a Ferrari among others.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
      But his personal Ferrari ran into problems with the clutch and Ferruccio, being the hands on person he was, <br>
      went to visit Enzo Ferrari to complain about it … Enzo refused to meet him as history is told, but that didn’t <br>
      stop Ferruccio Lamborghini.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      He noticed the clutch fitted to this Ferrari wasn’t any different from the ones Lamborghini mounted in their <br>
      tractors, so he drove the Ferrari to the Cento factory and had a Borg & Beck clutch installed straight from the <br>
      parts list of one if the tractor models … the problem never returned after that.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Ferruccio Lamborghini saw the tractor and oil burner business were taking care of themselves very nicely, <br>
      making him money without having to keep an eye on the factory too much, so he decided it was time to start <br>
      a new business … and Gran Turismo cars seemed like a good idea.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Ferruccio Lamborghini wasn’t known for being subtle, so in the early Sixties he had a completely new factory <br>
      built on an industrial area in Sant’Agata, solely dedicated to building the best GT cars of that time, he wasn’t <br>
      interested in highly tuned exotics back then, a smooth running V12 GT was his vision.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Unfortunately things took a turn for the worse, and after a series of deals going bad with the tractor factory <br>
      combined with the economical unrest in Italy, Ferruccio decided to sell his interest in most of his companies <br>
      during the Seventies and retire at his estate near Perugia, further South in Italy, where he began producing <br>
      wine … known as ‘The blood of the Miura’.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Ferruccio married Clelia Monti at an early age, in 1947 they had a son Antonio Lamborghini, also called <br>
      Tonino, unfortunately Clelia died giving birth. She was buried in the family grave and later on Ferruccio <br>
      remarried, this time with Annita Borgatti … but this second marriage didn’t last either, Ferruccio divorced her <br>
      and married a third time … Maria-Teresa Cane became the mother to Ferruccio’s daughter Patrizia. His son <br>
      Tonino moved to Japan and started a few shops selling designer clothing under the Lamborghini name.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Ferruccio’s large estate La Fiorita near the Lake Trasimeno now held a state of the art winemaking facility <br>
      producing over 800,000 bottles of wine each year. The estate also housed a small private museum <br>of Lamborghini 
      cars Ferruccio owned in those days, both the vineyard and the golf terrain were open for visitors, <br>
      albeit by appointment only
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      In this private car museum you would find Ferruccio’s favorite Lamborghini model, the Miura, there was even <br>
      talk about Ferruccio being involved in Paolo Stanzani’s attempt to take over the Bugatti Automobili SpA factory <br>
      but this was never officially confirmed.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      When Chrysler took over Automobili Lamborghini SpA they replaced the Countach, a car Ferruccio was still <br>
      involved with in the beginning, with the modern Diablo in the early Nineties, it would become the last Raging <br>
      Bull car he would ever experience … Ferruccio Lamborghini died on February 20. 1993 in Perugia, Italy … only <br>
      two months before his 77th birthday.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      A few years later Tonino Lamborghini created a tribute to his father, he contacted the architect Diversi in <br>
      Imola to design a kind of ‘arch’ to hold just about everything Sig. Ferruccio Lamborghini ever achieved during <br>
      his life.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The museum was constructed on the grounds of Lamborghini Calor, at Dosso di Ferrara, the official grand <br>
      opening occurred on May 13th, 1995. This project was named the Centro Polifunzionale <br>
      Ferruccio Lamborghini and reached great popularity the moment its doors opened for the public. All visits <br>
      were by appointment only, but still during 1997 over 4000 pilgrims came to visit this spectacular space-like <br>
      museum. If you ever have the opportunity to visit it, don’t hesitate it is surely worth it, I was able to visit it <br>
      during the summer of 1998 and it was overwhelming.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Today the vast collection of Ferruccio Lamborghini’s main industrial achievements, including a large number <br>
      of tractors and some of the most stunning cars ever made in Sant’Agata are on display in the even <br>
      larger Museo Ferruccio Lamborghini in Funo di Argelato.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      Tonino Lamborghini named his son Ferruccio Jr, in honor to his father … so if the Raging Bull cars won’t keep <br>
      the Lamborghini name alive, his grandson will …
